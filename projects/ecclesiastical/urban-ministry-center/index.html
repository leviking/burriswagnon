        <p>
          First Baptist Church of Jackson funded this project to renovate an abandoned apartment complex into an urban ministry center. The apartments were transformed into spaces for a volunteer medical and dental clinic, dormitory space for visiting church groups, office and community space, and a nursery. A new Multipurpose Building was added later, which includes a gymnasium/worship center, meeting and dining facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Phase I included the renovation of an existing apartment complex into a volunteer medical and dental clinic, dormitory space for visiting volunteer church groups, general office space for the complex, community education classrooms, child care center and playground / site development. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Phase II A new Multi-Purpose Building. This building includes a gymnasium/worship center seating 900, a meeting room seating 200, a warming kitchen, and general support. Design issues considered in the project included the design of an economical, yet very durable and resilient building, and the proportioning and siting of the Multi-Purpose Building so as to fit carefully into the existing residential fabric.
