        <p>
          Designed by eminent Mississippi Architect C.H. Lindsley, Bowles Hall was built in 1928 at the core of the Alcorn State Campus. Bowles Hall is a stately historic classroom building that was adaptively-reused as the administration building for the University’s leadership. The restoration/renovation of the building required a complete renovation and reconfiguration of all interior spaces, including all finishes, fixtures, HVAC, plumbing, life safety, electrical systems and access control and security systems, and the addition of an elevator for ADA compliance. Main corridors, entrances, and stairs were left intact to maintain the historic integrity of the structure, while all remaining space was reconfigured to serve a bustling, 21st century administrative function, including President’s, Provost’s, and vice-presidential offices. The original two-story school library was transformed into the President’s board/conference room. Exterior scope included restoration of the building envelope: repoint/waterproofing of masonry walls, restoration of cast stone, window frame restoration, and window and door replacement. The South entrance to the building, facing the campus green, was re-defined with extensive landscaping, including a slate-paved plaza, a pristine raised entrance lawn, and paved paths that facilitate, and connect with, campus ADA accessible routes. The extended landscape surrounding Bowles Hall was also planned, including the approach from the current administration building, and the spatial and visual connection with the campus dining hall. When implemented, this work will include new pathways, plaza areas, and green spaces.
