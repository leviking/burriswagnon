          To better prepare its students for Early Childhood Education teaching opportunities, the community college program desired space for instruction, including classroom and supervised laboratory/collaborative areas. The needs of three user groups — the college faculty and staff for the facility, the college student enrolled in the childhood education program, and the children enrolled in the childcare program — would be considered, and how these needs could be thoughtfully intertwined and cared for in a single building. Design considerations included the functional relationships among staff offices, college classrooms, children’s play and observation rooms, children’s dining room, and outdoor play areas.

          A huge part of a child’s day in childcare occurs at the front entrance — from an often tearful separation from a mom or dad, to a joyful afternoon reunion — all at the same spot. This building originates at, and organizes around, this pivotal spot, under a gracious, cantilevered canopy, protecting child and parent from sun and rain, in intimate space. Once transcending this threshold, the canopy extends into, and is expressed in, the front lobby, engaging a central spine, with college and faculty functions on one side, and children’s play and observation areas on the other. Clerestories in the main corridor provide and exchange natural light throughout the day with the children’s areas, through large observation windows. The hall gradates into the naturally-lit dining area, leading to the outdoor play areas through a wall of glass. Common, economical materials were used — steel and masonry — to create both interior, and exterior, spatial quality through thoughtful detailing. Exterior spatial experience is defined by the entrance canopy, carefully articulated cornices and roof water management systems, and a carefully placed exterior toy storage structure with covered play area, subtly transitioning children to the lower elevation of the main playground.
