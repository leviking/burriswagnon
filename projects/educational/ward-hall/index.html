          This project consists of pre-planning services relative to Ward Hall, designed in 1929 by Mississippi Architect C. H. Lindsley, an iconic, historic dormitory at the heart of Delta State’s campus. A thorough, whole-campus space allocation study was completed with the goal of determining the most appropriate use for a renovated Ward Hall. Then, existing functions of the residence hall were carefully considered as they related to possible new programmed functions. And finally, a new space program, based on all campus input, was proposed for the structure. The final renovation/restoration plan for the building fully incorporates new mechanical, plumbing, electrical and fire-suppression systems, and integration of applicable codes, including ADA-accessibility, as well as restoration strategies applicable to Mississippi Landmark structures. The final space plan included student performance enhancement offices such as Academic Support and Advising, Career Services and Placement, Honors Program, International Affairs, and Diversity and Multi-Cultural Affairs Office, as well as museum space for the Delta Institute, gallery space, and restoration of the historic front “living room”. As part of a holistic building approach, all envelope/waterproofing issues were studied and solutions proposed during this project.
