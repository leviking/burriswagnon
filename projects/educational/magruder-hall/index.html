        The project entails a renovation and restoration of historic 1938 Magruder Hall on Mississippi State University’s campus. First floor renovations will celebrate and remember the building’s original design characteristics, such as revealing the original plaster ceiling, revitalizing doors and transoms, and restoring the important trim elements and terrazzo floors. General renovations throughout the building shall include a new code-compliant elevator in a building addition, upgraded mechanical and electrical systems, new compliant women’s and men’s restrooms, new lighting and fire suppression systems, and compliant drinking fountains. The building addition will create a code-compliant and handicap accessible means of accessing both wings of the split-level building. The building will primarily function as an office space for an academic department. Exterior work on the bulding includes miscellaneous cast stone replacement and restoration, brick repointing, steel window restoration (with storm sashes added at interior), and a full reroof with flashing repair. In addition, all non-original construction (doors, windows, and wood cladding) shall be removed at facades and roof of connecting arcade, restoring it to its original open-air condition.
