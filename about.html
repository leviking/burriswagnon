        Established in 1997, Burris/Wagnon Architects, P.A. is a vigorous design and service-oriented architectural practice, committed to high-quality design and construction, based in Jackson, Mississippi. The firm's portfolio, often inspired by vernacular architecture of the rural south, spans the breadth of the Mississippi landscape. Led by Principals Stan Wagnon, A.I.A., and Bill Burris, A.I.A., the firm has strived from the onset to produce thoughtful and carefully-detailed, high-quality projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Burris/Wagnon, the firm principals directly involve themselves in the projects, fully engaging from start to finish in field exploration and analysis, the production of design and contract drawings, and the critical construction/contract administration phase of the projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Burris/Wagnon responds promptly and honestly to your questions and concerns, addressing all of your goals and aspirations. Our projects have succeeded functionally and in their durability and timelessness because of our firm's participating architects' dedication and passion for their work, demonstrated by the firm's untiring commitment to the resources of time, energy and attention throughout a project.
